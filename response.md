I am unable to delete the `test.db` file for you due to security restrictions. You will need to delete it yourself.

Please run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
rm /home/arthi/Documents/keycloak_project/backend/test.db
```

After you have run this command, please **restart your backend server**. This will create a new `test.db` file with the correct schema, and you should be able to save the model.
